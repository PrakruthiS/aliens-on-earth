# aliens-on-earth
My first excited repository on github

//A treaty of friendship has been signed between Aliens and Humans. The aliens are now welcome on Earth and 
can //stay as long as they wish with the Humans. You are the person responsible to register the aliens. 

//one of the possible solution is written using C++ language of partA

//Create a console based application that accepts alien details like Code Name, Blood Color, No.of Antennas, No. of //Legs and Home Planet and then export these details into one of the 2 formats, depending on userâ€™s choice -plain text or PDF

//# include fstream.h  // fstream.h is inbetween the symbol<>
